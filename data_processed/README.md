# Processed Data



This folder stores processed raster datasets generated after preprocessing steps such as clipping, reprojection, alignment, and normalization.



Files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.



To reproduce outputs:



1. Run GEE scripts in /gee\_scripts

2. Export rasters

3. Process using QGIS workflow described in documentation/methodology.md



Outputs generated from these datasets are available in the outputs folder.
