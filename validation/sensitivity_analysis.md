# Sensitivity Analysis



A deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how variation in predictor weights influences final habitat suitability outputs.



Weights assigned to environmental variables were systematically altered across multiple scenarios while keeping all preprocessing steps constant. Each scenario produced a new Habitat Suitability Index raster.



Spatial differences between model outputs were visually compared and assessed for stability of predicted suitability zones. Particular attention was given to shifts in high-suitability regions.



Results indicate that the spatial distribution of suitability classes remained largely stable under moderate weight variation, suggesting that model outputs are not excessively sensitive to minor parameter adjustments.



This analysis demonstrates relative robustness of model predictions under plausible ecological weighting uncertainty.
