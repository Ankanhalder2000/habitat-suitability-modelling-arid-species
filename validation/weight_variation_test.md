# Weight Variation Test



To evaluate robustness of the weighted overlay model, multiple alternative weighting schemes were applied.



Test scenarios included:



- Equal weights assigned to all predictors

- Increased climatic influence scenario

- Increased topographic influence scenario

- Reduced land cover influence scenario



Each scenario generated a separate suitability raster, which was compared against the original model output.



Comparisons showed that although numerical suitability values varied slightly, overall spatial patterns and classification zones remained consistent. High suitability areas were preserved across scenarios.



This indicates that model structure is stable and not overly dependent on a single weighting configuration.
