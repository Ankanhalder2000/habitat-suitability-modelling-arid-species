# Model Uncertainty Assessment



Sources of uncertainty in the habitat suitability model were identified and evaluated qualitatively.



Primary uncertainty sources include:



- Expert-defined suitability thresholds

- Absence of species occurrence records for validation

- Differences in spatial resolution among datasets

- Potential classification error in land cover data

- Static environmental predictors that do not account for temporal variability



Despite these limitations, uncertainty is constrained by the deterministic nature of the modelling workflow and consistent preprocessing across layers.



Future model versions will incorporate quantitative uncertainty estimation, including:



- ensemble modelling approaches

- sensitivity-derived uncertainty rasters

- statistical validation using occurrence data



These improvements will allow explicit spatial representation of prediction confidence.
