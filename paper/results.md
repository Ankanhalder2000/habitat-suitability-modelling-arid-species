# Results



The model produced continuous and classified habitat suitability rasters representing environmental suitability across the study region.



## Spatial Patterns

Higher suitability zones occur in regions with moderate temperature, intermediate precipitation, and stable precipitation seasonality.



Lower suitability regions correspond to extreme elevation or unsuitable land cover classes.



## Output Products

Generated outputs include:



- Continuous suitability raster

- Normalized suitability raster

- Classified suitability raster

- Predictor suitability layers



All outputs are available in the `/outputs` directory.
