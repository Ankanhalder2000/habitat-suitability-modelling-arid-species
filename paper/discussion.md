# Discussion



The model demonstrates how environmental gradients influence predicted habitat suitability across semi-arid landscapes. Temperature and precipitation variables appear to drive most spatial variation in suitability, which is consistent with ecological expectations for arid-adapted species.



The modelling approach illustrates how multiple environmental predictors can be integrated into a spatial decision-support framework. While the species niche used here is hypothetical, the workflow reflects real-world ecological modelling pipelines.



This framework can be extended to real species distribution modelling when occurrence data are available.
